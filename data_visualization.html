    <p class="content-text-big">In this image, Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels visualize gender disparity in pop culture by breaking down the scripts of some of the
      biggest movies in cinema history, Disney movies.<br> This chart, despite its simplicity, grabs your attention by showing the significant difference in dialogue
      between men and women in movies. It's easy to notice the lack of female-led narratives and the imbalance between genders, even in movies where the lead role is a woman, such as "Pocahontas" or "Mulan".
      The actual numbers, laid out in bold colors, confront us with a reality that's not immediately obvious just by watching the films.
      By focusing on the biggest box office hits, the visualization highlights how even the most popular movies have not given women equal time to speak.
      This graph is a straightforward but impactful reminder to consider who is heard in the stories we've grown up with, particularly in older movies,
      and how that's starting to change.</p>
